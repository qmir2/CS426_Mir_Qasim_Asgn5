Physics constructs: Mist/Fog particle mechanics in beginning and end of maze were used. Hover script was applied to laptop and milk cartons. 

Billboard: Rat sprites were added at the end of the maze that look at the player.

Lights: Point lights were used in green to light up the maze. Blue spot lights were used to brighten up the laptop that were needed to be collected. At the end of the maze fan was lit up with different rgb colors using point light.

Sounds: BUllet shooting sound was used. A shatter sound was used when laptop were collected. Meow sound was used when colliding with milk carton. At the end victory sound was used as well when finishing the maze.

All of these fit in the overall design as to add more liveliness to scene and with cat collecting the laptop with expectation that milk was also awaiting when a laptop is saved. Lights add more color to scene and the mist adds some mysterious element. The billboard with rat shows that the mother big laptop appreciated the cat and left four mouse for the cat to consume.
